## tgpt 2025

tgpt is a cross-platform command-line interface (CLI) tool that allows you to use AI chatbot in your Terminal without requiring API keys. Currently ...There are two experimental functions added, namely generate code and generate and execute shell commands. Although the app can generate snippets, it may not always work perfectly, but it can spare you from the trouble of typing out commands yourself.

The commands have also been updated in this sense, and now you can specify the provider and set the model. The app allows you to enter API keys, without which you can’t run certain models, like in the case of OpenAI, for instance. Groq also requires an API key to run, but you can obtain that for free.
